Hello everybody, and welcome to our very first in-real-life Brawlmachine battle report. My name is Max, and last Sunday, me and Mois√©s had a couple of games to test the new Syzygy scenario coming up in Brawlmachine 1.1. So without further ado, let's kick-off this battle report with our lists:

### Max - Trollbloods - Madrak Ironhide, Thornwood Chieftain - Storm of the North

</span>

This is one of my Madrak1 lists I‚Äôm trying to make work against Crucible Guard üòÉ. To my surprise, the mainboard list is the same posted by Philip in his LOS Brawlmachine Trollbloods List Building article, I guess great minds think alike!

Before Crucible CID, a relative weakness of that faction seemed to be limited hitfixing ability, at least outside of Syvestro‚Äôs feat turn. In this way, Madrak with Champions used to be a good all-rounder who could heal chipping shots damage on approach, protect army from alpha charges and help turn direct shots into misses or relatively safe blasts. With Guided Hand I can spare the points on the Fell Caller and at least have a chance of hitting his higher-def models in melee. Post-CID even the Assault troopers are hard to hit, capping at relative def 17, both melee and shooting, vs living models with Transmutation and Ascendant Mentalist around.
Storm of the North theme ensures most of my models are immune to cold, which renders Suppressor‚Äôs Ice Cage useless.

### Mois√©s - Crucible Guard - Syvestro - Magnum Opus

#### Mois√©s
> I haven't played Assault Troopers in a very long time and wanted to see how much they improved during CID trying this DEF skew build with an Ascendant Mentalist and upgraded Warjacks. I really like Syvestro's transmute spell as I prefer to have my opponents boosting attack rolls than damage rolls, the Mentalist's bubble can bring my Troopers' DEF up to 17 without relying on terrain and up to 19 if they can get cover. Suppressor and Vindicator are such a great duo in Brawl that I don't remember the last time I had a Toro on the table.

> To better fight Max's list, I boarded out Alyce and Hutchuck in favor of the Dragon's Breath Rocket for the lovely -2 ARM no-tough AOE 4, and the Rocketman Stinger to make sure I hit my high priority targets.

## GAME 1

### Trollbloods deployment

</span>

I won initiative and decided to go first to grab some board space. I initially thought the top side to be worse due to the more exposed flag and objective, but I was probably wrong on that one :D, I‚Äôve placed my Snowdrifts centrally with one allowing my solo to camp flag while having concealment.

From left side you can see Pyre troll (not surprising considering the burning earth), I deployed my Champs centrally with Valka in second line, Impaler in position to snipe most of the targets turn 2, right next to him is Madrak, Dhunian Archon and Earthborn on the flank. My whelp waited to spawn as I thought it might make a difference against his Assault boys. On the middle right you can notice the Dhunian objective marker I made out of clay :P

#### Moises

> I started deployment with my DBR trying to place it as much as possible to the center line while avoiding the shallow water. Next I added Syvestro and my Warjacks also trying to avoid the water and considering Syvestro's Super Fuel. Finally, I filled the gaps with Assault Troopers and the Mentalist (proxied with Big Alyce) behind them, the Rocketman Stinger (proxied by a regular rocketman) and the Trancer started to the side planning to go around the building.

### Trollbloods round 1

Turn 1 I just ran my stuff forward paying attention not to be within Vindicator‚Äôs 19" shooting range and put the Impaler in a way that interrupted Madrak‚Äôs charge. I cast Even Ground just in an off scenario something would need to roll tough, since he couldn‚Äôt get all the way up on board anyways.

</span>

### Crucible Guard round 1

Moises ran most of his stuff forward, super-fueled the jacks and Vindicator with DBR took deviation shots on champs which drifted nicely (for him) and chipped in some damage - second deviation is a thing, I‚Äôm telling you! Syvestro put all his upkeeps around - Explosivo on Suppressor, Admonition on himself and Transmutation on Assault Troopers.

Ascendant Mentalist put force Aura, moved 6 and repoed 3 - talk about mobility! Suppressor and Rocketman Stinger hid behind the building - and this is the moment I understood how annoying these will be to get rid off now - while Trancer ran all the way into rubble right from my flag.

### Trollbloods round 2

It‚Äôs time to grab some board space! The thing about CG lists is that even if they are pretty melee-centric, like this one, they still have a considerable amount of shooting that will force engagement. I ran my champs forward with the front 2 ones in B2B for defensive line and outside of most of his walk and punch threats on Assault troopers. Valka positioned himself behind, ready to countercharge - but he was a tad bit too far into range where he could be engaged by Assaults. Impaler threw a nice crit shot on Vindicator, chipped in around 8 dmg (nothing crippled), and slammed him 5‚Äù backwards (due to the angles nothing got hit though). Pyre and Madrak gave Flaming Fists to 2 Champions (marked by orange beads), Mad cast Even Ground and feated while Dhunian Archon sat on the flag.

Side view with more action :D

### Crucible Guard round 2

Moises stood up Vindicator for a focus and went for the offensive. Syvestro handled some focus around and put Impenetrable Haze on himself. First off to attack was the Dragon Breath Rocket which could aim and hit Valka, giving -2 arm and no tough to most of my champs, Earthborn and Impaler. Vindicator shot Valka and boy did the boosted blasts hurt the champs. Suppressor sprayed them a bit, killing one Champ and even triggering the explosivo blast (this rarely comes into play), which did nothing though. The Assault Troopers needed to get in and only finished 1 Champ off, needing 7s to hit and with one punch turned off by Archon. Mentalist moved up for the Psychokinetic Shield. 
On the right flank Stinger flew in, blinded the remaining Champ and Earthborn, and repo into nasty position. Trancer tried to slam Dhunian Archon but came short even with boosted attack.

Score: Trollbloods 0 - 1 Crucible Guard

### Trollbloods round 3

Counter-attack time! Actually I was in bad position and my plan was to stall for time since Moises had 11 minutes left on his clock against mine 20-ish. Pyre Troll moved up and deviated fire on Stinger, then Flame Fisted the Champ by burning earth. This turned out a bit meaningless since I decided to take him out boldly anyways to not lose out on scenario. Dhunian Archon managed to hit and explode the Trancer, while Mads put Guided Hand on himself, boosted hit and killed Stinger, camping on 0 with Scroll for nullifying one damage roll and bloodbooned Even Ground . Earthborn tried to pick the Assault Trooper for throw (wanted to throw him at mentalist), but missed the boosted attack needing 9 to hit (even being immune to fire, +2 from Transmute and +2 from Mentalist‚Äôs aura), so he spent his remaining 2 fury to buy a boosted attack on an Assault Trooper and snacked him. Champs needed to press forward and clean up three Assaults, not realizing how futile this was... 

Score: Trollbloods 1 - 2 Crucible Guard

### Crucible Guard round 3

It‚Äôs feat turn for the Crucible Guard. Syvestro drops Explosivo, puts focus on Jacks, revives 1 Assault Trooper from free spell. Combined attacks of DBR, Suppressor‚Äôs and Mentalist‚Äôs sprays, Vindicator and Assault Troopers wipe out most of my army, with Archon dying while trying to protect a Champ (rolled exactly 3 dmg - probably was my mistake to even attempt doing it). Whelp popped up next to Earthborn but without much chance to run off contesting flag.
With only Earthborn, Pyre, Mad and Whelp I‚Äôve conceded the game.

Score: Trollbloods 1 - CG 3

Victory to CG!

## GAME 2

We used the opportunity of the Best of Two system (which we usually don‚Äôt manage to timewise) and I had a choice whether to start or pick side. Took the other side this time since the building turned out really good defensively for his sneaky solos.

I haven‚Äôt taken the deployment photos, but setup was practically the same as previously and we did not sideboard anything. I have also forgotten to put my Snowdrift terrain pieces from the Storm of the North theme force :P

### Crucible Guard round 1

Syvestro cast his upkeeps - Transmutation on Assaults, Admonition on Vindicator and Explosivo on Suppressor, supefueled and charged forward, rest of his troops run into positions (watching out for 20‚Äù Impaler‚Äôs threat range from far strike + assault).

### Trollbloods round 1

I spread out my models, especially Champs, to avoid being too affected by blasts and sprays. Pyre Troll walks 5 and attempts to deviate well on Stinger - and manages to, even though I needed to roll specifically direction 1 and 4 - 6 inches! He set him on fire, but cannot deal any blast damage :c Madrak casts Even Ground and walks forward.

### Crucible Guard round 2

During Maintenance phase‚Ä¶ fire expired on the Stinger u ___ U. Syvestro loaded Jacks a bit and Hazed himself on the flag. DBR went up and shot Madrak - managed to hit and did like 4 damage. Vindicator aimed and shot Madrak too, I needed to transfer that damage to Impaler I think. Most of Assault Troopers moved just a tad bit forward to pressure the zone, while one stood in the middle protecting approach to Syvestro. Stinger went in and blinded-sidestepped two of my Champs. Trancer creeps behind the building just within 8 walking inches from my Impaler.

### Trollbloods round 2

It turned out if I removed that one Assualt trooper, Earthborn would have had Syvestro in charge range thanks to extra speed from water terrain, but since I didn‚Äôt remind Moises about that during his positioning, we decided to carry on as if he was speed 5. I still wanted to somehow remove that Assault guy so I tried with Impaler first - and he hit without crit and did 1 damage (Carapace is nasty when it works), so I risked going in with Madrak and throwing Rathrok with boosted attack (needed 9), but missed. I cast Even Ground, staying on 1 fury and feated, healing Madrak and all chip damage from before. Earthborn went up to clear that pesky Assault guy, and this time managed to throw him at another Assault Trooper (the third from left), to knock him down. I boosted damage killing the thrown one and cast animus, not really sure why - and by putting Earthborn on 4 furies it seems I sealed my fate.

Pyre Troll went as close as possible to Stinger and tried to deviate - with one deviation covering both him and my champ who was b2b! He cast Flaming Fists on that Champ to have the fire expire (in hindsight, probably Madrak deserved that animus more).

Champs pressed forward so that the only one in position to charge could have gotten in on the DBR and Vindicator, which moved back thanks to Admonition. The trenching Champ moved out of Stinger‚Äôs melee and got hit by a shadowbinding free strike, to add insult to injury. I also couldn‚Äôt dhunian (Threads of Life) that attack since Incise is not a damage roll, in fact. The charging Champ attacked twice the DBR but both grunts were there for take up.

Dhunian Archon hanged way too much in the back so she could not protect to forwarmost Champ in his duty of tying up the DBR.

Looking at the picture below, I really did expose Madrak way too much.

Score: CG 1 - Trollbloods 0 (Stinger contested my flag I think)

### Crucible Guard round 3

Moises evaluated his position and decided he‚Äôs got a go at Madrak during the feat turn - he just needed to untangle his army a bit.

After feeding the jacks, Syvestro feated, moved up and free spelled Stygian Abyss on Madrak which did not crit but dealt quite good boosted damage. Second Stygian crit blinded Madrak to def 12. Assault Troopers activated, the one on the right getting into Champs back arc, hitting twice with some atrocious damage that left all my Champs on 1 box and killing the one I needed the most. Rest of the unit went into the Earthborn and brought him down to around 10 hp (that's some massive damage considering he was 14/20 and no charges were done). As usual, I forgot to spawn whelp who would make hitting Earthborn just that bit more difficult.

Stinger jumped around, poking Valka with Blind and side stepping onto Madrak to shadowbind him and sidestep outside of engagement - so Mads was Def 9 and down to 10 boxes. DBR aimed and shot Madrak, who needed to transfer damage into Impaler. Trancer came from behind building on left, and was ideally within 8 inches to hit and slam Impaler into Madrak, killing the Impaler - which actually was a good thing for me since I gained 1 extra fury for transfer. 

Suppressor went up and sprayed Madrak twice, I transferred one damage roll into Pyre who died and gave me 2 fury, unfortunately Earthborn was full, second damage needed to be scrolled. Vindicator aimed and shot Madrak to death, while Mentalist was still on stand-by to use her spray.

Victory by Caster Kill to CG!

## Summary

### Thoughts on Syzygy

After those games I am not fully convinced on the scenario. It is quite demanding for slower armies which can struggle to clear their own flag and contest opponent‚Äôs one (this can be also affected heavily by terrain), while objectives are always behind models and unless you really want to score that 1 point for victory there is little incentive to go after them (which might be also the goal of scenario, but they just felt irrelevant).

### Thoughts on games

Admittedly, I did struggle into Crucible Guard before CID since their toolbox against Trollbloods is really broad. Post-CID the bar seems to go even higher as they got tuned up on damage, accuracy and annoyance. I will test Madrak few times more but will probably have to try out some new drop into Guard, such as Ragnor or Gunnbjorn1 (I don‚Äôt own Kolgrimma, sadly! :P )

From my side, mistakes were definitely made as Moises is really good at putting pressure from the distance - sometimes no matter what you do you will be in a hard spot. I still had great time playing these games, felt awesome to put models on the table, and I so much look forward to another brawlin time :D
